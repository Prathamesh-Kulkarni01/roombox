// This component is now deprecated and its logic has been moved directly into
// the GuestProfilePage to resolve a printing issue with react-to-print.
// The new implementation uses a hidden div with a ref, which is a more robust
// pattern for printing dynamic content. This file can be safely removed.
// The new printable component is named PoliceVerificationFormContent inside
// src/app/dashboard/tenant-management/[guestId]/page.tsx
